Welcome to our CLI Python game, where Knight meets Dragon. If fate will have it and your heart is valiant we hope that you defeat the Dragon and rescue the princess.

In this game we inlude the use of: 

1 - Turn based program \
2 - Random funtion to implement chance \
3 - Classes \
4 - Methods \
5 - Variables \
6 - Loops \
7 - Error key response \
8 - Character choice 

In this program you will be able to choose your charachter, and decide whether you want to attack or charm the dragon. These choices will then be implemented into a function that randomly decides how much damadge you take and implement as well as giving the dragon chance to attack you. Based on choices and chance you will eventually either rescue the dragon or be slain..... if you are slain you will get the opportunity to choose a different charahter and try again!
